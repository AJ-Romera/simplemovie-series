# I WILL NOT CONTINUE THIS PROJECT

I found out I need more practice with Redux and Middlewares. I´m problem I found is that when I Reload/Refresh the web, the state is lost and I don´t find a good fix for this.

Now I´m gonna watch Redux tutorials and practice on another project. Maybe I come back and finish this project in the future.
